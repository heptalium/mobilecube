MobileCube - RoundCube Mail Theme

Version 3.1.0 beta

MobileCube is a skin for the RoundCube (http://roundcube.net/) PHP web mail app styled after Apple's MobileMe web mail client. It was developed by PhireWare (http://phireware.com/) as a SourceForge project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mobilecube/).

The author has apparently given up development on this theme in favour of CrystalMail (http://www.crystalmail.net/), which is itself now dormant. This is a fork from the last version posted on SourceForge.

The orginal theme bundled the RoundCube calendar plugin, but that is now maintained separately as part of the myroundcube plugin bundle (http://code.google.com/p/myroundcube/), so it is removed from this repository and to rearrange the folders to simplify it.

The beta release this was forked from has some problems, some of which are described in this post (http://www.roundcubeforum.net/8-themes-styling/28-theme-releases/6012-new-mobileme-mobilecube-17.html#post34907). Those changes have applied in this repo.
